# Building a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server: A Practical Guide

This repository contains a working example of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation. We've created a weather service to demonstrate how to build, package, and deploy an MCP server that can integrate with AI models and applications.

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI models to interact with external tools and services in a standardized way. Think of it as a universal translator between AI models and the tools they need to use. When an AI model needs to check the weather, analyze data, or perform any external action, MCP provides the framework for this communication.

## Why This Example Matters

Building an MCP server might seem daunting at first, but this weather service example breaks down the process into understandable components. We've chosen weather data because it's:
- Familiar to everyone
- Complex enough to show real-world patterns
- Simple enough to understand quickly

## Core Concepts Demonstrated

Through this example, you'll learn how to:

1. Structure an MCP server using Python
2. Define and implement tools that AI models can use
3. Handle asynchronous communication via STDIO
4. Package your server for distribution
5. Integrate with different AI platforms

## Getting Started

We've organized the documentation into several guides:

1. [Understanding MCP Server Structure](docs/server_structure.md) - Core components and their roles
2. [Implementation Guide](docs/implementation.md) - Step-by-step walkthrough of the code
3. [Installation and Running](docs/installation.md) - Different ways to deploy your server
4. [Integration Guide](docs/integration.md) - Connecting with Claude Desktop and other platforms

## Quick Start

If you're eager to see the server in action, follow these steps:

1. Install using UV (recommended):
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

2. Run the server:
```bash
uv --directory path/to/project run mcp_weather_service_stdio
```

3. Test with the MCP inspector:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory path/to/project run mcp_weather_service_stdio
```

## Learning Path

If you're new to MCP, we recommend following this learning path:

1. Start by reading the [Understanding MCP Server Structure](docs/server_structure.md) guide
2. Experiment with running the server using the Quick Start instructions
3. Study the implementation details in [Implementation Guide](docs/implementation.md)
4. Try modifying the server to add new capabilities
