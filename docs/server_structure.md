# Understanding MCP Server Structure

An MCP server acts as a bridge between AI models and external functionality. Let's break down how this works using our weather service example.

## The Big Picture

Imagine you're building a translator that helps AI models talk to weather services. The AI model might say "What's the weather in Paris?" but the weather service needs specific API calls and data structures. Your MCP server handles this translation.

## Core Components

### 1. The Server Class

The heart of our implementation is the `WeatherServer` class. Let's look at its key components:

```python
class WeatherServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.app = Server("weather-mcp-server-stdio")
        self.setup_tools()
```

This initializes the MCP server framework. Think of it as setting up a reception desk where requests will be handled.

### 2. Tool Registration

Tools are the services your server provides to AI models. They're like a menu of available actions:

```python
@self.app.list_tools()
async def list_tools() -> list[Tool]:
    return [
        Tool(
            name="get_current_weather",
            description="Get current weather and forecast for a location",
            inputSchema={...}
        )
    ]
```

Each tool needs:
- A name: How the AI will refer to it
- A description: Helps the AI understand when to use it
- An input schema: The information the tool needs to work

### 3. Tool Implementation

The actual work happens in the tool implementation:

```python
@self.app.call_tool()
async def call_tool(name: str, arguments: Any) -> Sequence[TextContent]:
    if name == "get_current_weather":
        location = arguments["location_name"]
        weather = await Weather().get_forecast(location)
        return [TextContent(text=json.dumps(weather_data))]
```

This is where you:
1. Receive requests from the AI
2. Perform the necessary actions
3. Return results in a format the AI can understand

### 4. Communication Layer

MCP servers communicate via STDIO (Standard Input/Output). Our run method handles this:

```python
async def run(self):
    async with stdio_server() as (read_stream, write_stream):
        await self.app.run(read_stream, write_stream, init_options)
```

Think of this as the postal service that delivers messages between the AI and your server.

## How It All Fits Together

When an AI model wants weather information:

1. It asks for a list of available tools
2. Your server responds with the tool descriptions
3. The AI chooses a tool and provides the required arguments
4. Your server processes the request and returns the results
5. The AI receives and interprets the response

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always provide clear error messages that help diagnose issues:
   ```python
   try:
       weather = await Weather().get_forecast(location)
   except Exception as e:
       raise RuntimeError(f"Weather API error: {str(e)}")
   ```

2. **Logging**: Include comprehensive logging for debugging:
   ```python
   logging.debug(f"Getting weather for {location_name}")
   ```

3. **Type Safety**: Use type hints and validate inputs:
   ```python
   if not isinstance(arguments, dict) or "location_name" not in arguments:
       raise ValueError("Invalid weather arguments")
   ```

4. **Documentation**: Document your tools thoroughly in their descriptions

## Common Patterns

1. **Async Operations**: MCP servers are asynchronous by design, allowing efficient handling of multiple requests.

2. **State Management**: While our example is stateless, you can maintain state between requests if needed.

3. **Resource Management**: Use context managers (`async with`) to handle resources properly.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the structure, you might want to:

1. Examine the [Implementation Guide](implementation.md) for detailed code walkthrough
2. Learn about [Installation and Running](installation.md) options
3. Explore adding new tools to the server

Remember: The structure we've shown here is a foundation. As you build more complex MCP servers, you'll discover additional patterns and requirements, but these core concepts will remain the same.
